# mey-aquatics
Includes static website assets, research, and Google app scripts to serve meysaquatics.com. Mey's Aquatics is the product of my family's hobbies around raising and breeding endangered fish.

I built this website for them to better communicate what they are up to and what fish they have available.

It is still very much a work in progress.
