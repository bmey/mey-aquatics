questions:
- decide what to do with collection point (show X from wild, Y from MA? or just that there are some wild, some MA?)
- species list is what will show on website (even if no stock)?
  + 0 fish will show "not avail" / add column to specify (confirm)
- should there be more than one picture per species? (gender, size)
- separate entries for species in different origins? (confirm)
- questionnaire in email
- Altolamprologus calvus (multiple common names - calvus black, gold head, red fin, white)?
- Abino dragonblood same scientific name as european dragonblood
- in stock, not in species
  + Spotted Talking Catfish (Agamyxis pectinifrons)
  + Green Terror (Andinoacara rivulatus syn.)
  + Red Nyasa peacock (Aulonocara Nyassae)
  + Albino Dragonblood (Aulonocara jacobfreibergi)
  + Masked Brichardi (Chalinochromis brichardi)
- in species, not stock
  + Golden Zebra Danio (Danio rerio)
  + Neon Tetra (Paracheirodon innesi)
- in pictures, not in stock or species
  + Tropheus sp. Red Cheecks
- common names different in stock vs species
  + Dogtooth cichlid / Red Top Cichlid (Cynotilpia Afra)

fix in google doc:
- add # to keep to stock list
- rows for data need to be right under header (e.g. missing #) 
- some fish not represented in "species" list (like green terror)
- fill out size in stock list (B, L, M, S)
  + currently only on species list
- depending on answer to multiple picture per species
  + multiple by size, add column in species list
  + multiple by gender, add new sheet
  + multiple by both, add 2 columns in species list
  + single, add new sheet

  
other notes:
- some missing common / scientific name
- ignoring count, avail, and CP from species list
- ignoring cares, pair, food, tank from stock list
- keep headers same or change on settings tabs

to discuss:
- how to publish
- how to manage pictures
- if traffic/use grows, may have to pay
